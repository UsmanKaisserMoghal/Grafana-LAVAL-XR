# Grafana-LAVAL-XR
A Grafana gig to grab data form a timeseries datasource, and log the active duration of a VR session, and see which objects were tracked and for how long.

NOTE: Provided json/query files are partial samples, meant only to show the direction of work involved in creating the grafana dashboard. The full work is not available for public.
